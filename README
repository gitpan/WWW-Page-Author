NAME
    WWW::Page::Author - locates the author of a web page

SYNOPSIS
        use WWW::Page::Author;
        my $pa = WWW::Page::Author->new;
        print $pa->get_author('http://www.apple.com/');

DESCRIPTION
    The WWW::Page::Author module attempts to determine the author of a
    web page. It does this by examining the HTTP headers, HTML headers
    and the body of the HTML document.

METHODS
    WWW::Page::Author->new()
        Creates a new author seeking object.

    $pa->get_author($url)
        Returns the author of the web page (or site) or undef. $url can
        either be an HTTP::Response object, a URI object or just a
        string URL.
